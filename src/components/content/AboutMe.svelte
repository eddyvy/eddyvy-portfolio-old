    <p>
        I am an Aerospace Engineer and a Pilot. Now I am currently studying a Computer Science Degree.
        <br>I born the 7th July of 1993 in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, where I live nowadays.

    <h5>How did I arrive here?</h5>
    <p>
        After High School I was accepted in the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM) for studying what I had chosen, Aerospace engineering.
        <br>During last year of the Degree I started to work into a little airline company called Privilege Style as engineer in Mallorca.
        <br>After 2 years working there I leave when accepted to join a Pilot Cadet Program of Iberia, the program was done in Flight Training Europe in Jerez, Spain.
        <br>Once I finished the Pilot studies I decided to roll up in an Online Computer Science Degree in the International Valencia University.

    <h5>Why Computer Science?</h5>
    <p>
        Because what I most love about engineering is programming.
        <br>I discovered it during my studies but aviation took me to a lot of different places since I decided to take the step.
        <br>If I love technologies and I can be hours in front of a computer programming... why not?
        <br>I started studying by myself thanks to online courses at Platzi and then joinning the career.
